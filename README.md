# Full Stack Resume

This project is a POC project to show how a full stack application can be started.  To demonstrate this I wanted to make a web application that utlizes micro services.

## Stack

|Component|Description| 
|----------|-------------|
|Services|Micro services are build using SpringBoot, Java 8, Maven and Reactor.|
|Front End|The UI is based on React and Node JS.| 
|Database|PostgreSQL|
|Containerization|Docker, Docker Compose|


## Idea
The idea is to build a resume application where the collection of different attributes of a candidate can demonstarte the use of the stack mentioned above. Utilizing the micro frontend and micro service architecture it will be a good idea to divide all these attribute section in to a vertical slice i.e. Each section of the resume should be supported by different set of micro services so that if one fails the whole resume UI should be effected.

## Architecture

## Outcome

## Cloud
### Heroku
#### Failure
### AWS
#### Failure
#### Work Around

## Outcome

## CI-CD

## Future Thoughts:
Breaking the UI in to micro front end architecture.
